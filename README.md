# SMS-Spam-Ham-Classifier-Multinomial--and-Bernoulli-Naive-Baye

A full-fledged implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier in Python on the ‘SMS Spam Ham data set’.

Here the model is made using sklearns two algorithms
1. Multinomial Naive Bayes
2. Bernoulli Naive Bayes

The preprocessing steps are very simple and easy to understand since very basic approaches are takes.
